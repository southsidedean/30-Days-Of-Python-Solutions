# 30-Days-Of-Python Programming Challenge: My Solutions

## Tom Dean

This GitHub repository contains my solutions to the 30-Days-Of-Python Programming Challenge (https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python).  I've provided my solutions to help folks who might want another perspective.  These solutions represent my interpretations of the exercises and content.  Your solutions may differ.  That doesn't necessarily make either of us wrong.

Enjoy!
